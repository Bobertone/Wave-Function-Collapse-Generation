# Wave-Function-Collapse-Generation
A project I did for my Advanced AI class that generates a screen of tiles placed next to each other in a way where only certain tiles can be next to one another.

Use the GridManager object in the Hierarchy to change parameters of the tiles to be generated.
You can change:
- Grid Width
- Grid Height
- Max Step Size (this is just the cutoff for showing each step of the generation)
- Tileset ID (either 0 or 1. 0 Is Gameboy Green and 1 is grayscale)
